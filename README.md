# PPCA
This is a programme for realizing PPCA (Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis).

In this project, PPCA are realized through both python and R. Meanwhile, there are .Rmd and .ipynb files for convenient reading.

In addition, some examples including mixture PPCA and PPCA with missing data are also realized. These can be found in PPCA.Rmd.
